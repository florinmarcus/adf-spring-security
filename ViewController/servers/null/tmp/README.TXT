This directory contains internal files used by the deployment system. Contents of this directory should never be removed while the corresponding server is running. Removing sub-directories when the server is down will slow down the subsequent deployment of the corresponding applications because these sub-directories need to be created again. The individual sub-directories are removed when the corresponding application is undeployed.
